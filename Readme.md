# Wiki-Maker 

The goal of this project was to create a script who build a wiki.
We start with a list of file in Markdown and we would like to generate a document in Markdown, HTML and PDF.

### Requirements

> [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

> [latex]

### How to use
Generate for all type (HTML, Markdown and PDF).

```
make all
```

Generate for a specific type.
```
make pdf

make html

make markdown   
```

By default a simple make will generate the document in Markdown.
